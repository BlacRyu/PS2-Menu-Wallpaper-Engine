Needs:
	Current Date
	Access Vertex Colors or second UV in shader

Tasks:

Try clouds as a tessellated cylinder (or cone) with vertex offsets


User Customization

	Modes
		Clock mode
			One prism lights up based on the hour, additional emissive value added to a fraction of the prism based on the minutes (uv.y * minute / 60)

		Audio-responsive mode
			Prisms light up based on audio channels
			? Global screenshake / fov-jolt based on jumps in overall amplitude

	Colors
		Clouds color
		Crystal Color






Done:

Crystal Material
	Diffuse (cloudy noise)
	Refraction
	Reflection (maybe just specular)
	Emissive

Crystal Rotation
	three.js
		local rotation
		translation
		group rotation

	Parented rotation
		parentMat = rotMatX * rotMatY * rotMatZ
		localMat = rotMatZ (dynamic, shared) * rotMatY (static, individual per prism) * translate (static, individual per prism)
		finalMat = localMat * parentMat
